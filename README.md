## Project Overview  
In this project, I explored the **Sakila Movie SQL Database** to understand relational database concepts and perform end-to-end data analysis.  
The project involved **data cleaning, transformation, and advanced SQL querying** to uncover insights about movie rentals, customers, and store performance.  

Through structured queries and analytical reasoning, I derived **data-driven insights** to support **strategic business decisions** in the film rental industry.  


## Key Objectives  
- Investigate and understand the **Sakila relational database schema**.  
- Perform **data cleaning and transformation** to ensure consistency and accuracy.  
- Write **complex SQL queries** involving joins, subqueries, aggregations, and window functions.  
- Analyze customer behavior, rental trends, and movie popularity.  
- Generate insights for **strategic decisions** such as inventory optimization and revenue forecasting.  


## Tools & Technologies  
- **MySQL** → for querying and managing the Sakila database  
- **SQL** → for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis  
- **Sakila Sample Database** → a standard test database for SQL learning and analytics  


## Key Insights  
- Identified the **top-performing movie genres** based on total rentals and revenue.  
- Analyzed **customer segmentation** by rental frequency and location.  
- Discovered **store-level performance differences**, aiding in targeted marketing.  
- Highlighted **seasonal patterns** in rentals and revenue trends.


## SQL Concepts Applied  
- SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY  
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and UNION  
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN)  
- Subqueries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Window functions for ranking and trend analysis  


## Outcome  
This project demonstrates proficiency in **relational database querying**, **data transformation**, and **analytical storytelling using SQL**.  
The insights drawn from the Sakila database emphasize how SQL can power business intelligence in the entertainment industry.
